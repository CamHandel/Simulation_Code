# Simulation_Management
The directory "Simulation Management" contains modified versions of the python scripts used to submit/analyse simulation data. All functions are run from main.py

# Data_Extraction
The directory "Data_Extraction" contains the C++ codes (modified from those provided to me by Saikat) which were used to extract key simulation data from the LAMMPS dump files.

rotation.cpp: this file extracted and calculated velocity data, seperation data, and kinetic energy data
workDone.cpp: this file calculated the work done by the wall
